# Background of the author. 
As a newbie in the data science world, I would like to use the coronavirus data to practice my data wrangling skills. 
As a Chinese-American, I have spent more than half of my life here in US than in China. I have paid attention to the news in China while Wuhan and other places in China were experiencing the covid-19 spreading. Now, I am experiencing covid-19 spread in US. Beside trying my best to do the social distancing, I would like to make my small portion of contribution to the covid-19 analysis. 

I am hoping we will get through this soon and wish the best for everyone!
